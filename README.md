**BRADYCARDIA AND ATRIAL FIBRILLATION DETECTION**

Bradycardia and atrial fibrillation are distinct cardiac arrhythmias characterized by irregularities in heart rhythm, each posing unique challenges to cardiovascular health. Bradycardia, marked by an abnormally slow heart rate, can result in insufficient blood flow to meet the body's demands. It often manifests as dizziness, fatigue, and fainting, necessitating intervention to prevent complications. On the other hand, atrial fibrillation, characterized by erratic and rapid contractions of the atria, disrupts blood flow through the heart. This condition increases the risk of stroke and heart failure due to the formation of blood clots. Both bradycardia and atrial fibrillation underscore the critical importance of accurate monitoring and timely diagnosis in managing cardiovascular health, with advancements in technology playing a pivotal role in enhancing detection and intervention strategies.

The details of a painstakingly designed system for monitoring and identifying bradycardia and atrial fibrillation, two heart rhythms with significant clinical implications, are explored in this article. Our approach, based on the cumulative effects of body temperature and SpO2 combined with machine learning algorithms, provides a complete answer for the early detection of these disorders, opening the door to prompt intervention and better patient outcomes.

Our project involves the usage of an Arduino UNO, ESP8266, MAX30100(heart rate and SpO2 sensor), and DS18B20(temperature sensor) to calibrate the Heart Rate, SpO2, and Temperature levels of an individual and appropriately classify it into 3 conditions - normal, atrial fibrillation and bradycardia.
