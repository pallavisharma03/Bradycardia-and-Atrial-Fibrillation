Bradycardia and atrial fibrillation are distinct cardiac arrhythmias characterized by irregularities in heart rhythm, each posing unique challenges to cardiovascular health. Bradycardia, marked by an abnormally slow heart rate, can result in insufficient blood flow to meet the body's demands. It often manifests as dizziness, fatigue, and fainting, necessitating intervention to prevent complications. On the other hand, atrial fibrillation, characterized by erratic and rapid contractions of the atria, disrupts the coordinated pumping of blood through the heart. This condition increases the risk of stroke and heart failure due to the formation of blood clots. Both bradycardia and atrial fibrillation underscore the critical importance of accurate monitoring and timely diagnosis in managing cardiovascular health, with advancements in technology playing a pivotal role in enhancing detection and intervention strategies.

The details of a painstakingly designed system for the monitoring and identification of bradycardia and atrial fibrillation—two heart rhythms with significant clinical implications—are explored in this article. Our approach, which is based on the cumulative effects of body temperature and SpO2 combined with machine learning algorithms, provides a complete answer for the early detection of these disorders, opening the door to prompt intervention and better patient outcomes.

The research also describes how real-time monitoring features are integrated, allowing for ongoing heart activity tracking. The system's easy connection with cloud-based platforms expands its usefulness to remote healthcare settings in addition to improving accessibility. This study describes the system's architecture, features, and therapeutic implications, establishing it as a significant development in the field of atrial fibrillation and bradycardia monitoring.
